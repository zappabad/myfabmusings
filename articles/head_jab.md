# Of Heads and Jabs

## Intro
I will simply start this article with the **most extreme version** of my take, and procede to give arguments and examples as to why I think a *less* extreme version of it is right:

    Flesh and Blood is a game about Head Jabs. Every card is Head Jab.

If that didn't peak your interest, then I don't know what will.

Let's unpack it.

## What is a Head Jab?
Throughout my article, I will refer to "a Head Jab" as a card that, **by itself, generated 3 points of value.** Blocking for 3 is a Head Jab. Pitching for 3 is a Head Jab. Attacking for 3 (without using your Action Point!) is a Head Jab.

I will already retract on my initial statement. No, not all cards are Head Jabs. Some are **Head Jab-plus** (they generate 4 values by themselves) and some are **Head Jab-minus** (they generate 2 value). The idea of being a Head Jab is that it's the most simple card to explain "this is worth 3 by itself"... and it also sounds cool to say "Head Jab-plus".

### The Action Point Problem

Let's look at Head Jab's cousin: Wounding Blow. This card looks like a more powerful version of Head Jab. But... it actually is a Head Jab, if you look it at it the right way.

When you attack with a Wounding Blow, **playing the card itself was 3 value.** It just so happens that Wounding Blow **uses up your Action Point** in order to attack for 1 more. In other words: when a card **doesn't** have Go Again written on it, imagine it instead says *"consumes your AP for 1 more damage."*

So, when calculating what the card itself named Wounding Blow does, it can be a Head Jab in two dimensions: **blocking** (as it blocks for 3 and doesn't use up your AP) or **playing** (as it does, by itself, 3 damage and let's you use your AP for another 1 point of damage).

Head Jab, on the other hand, is less flexible. It can only generate 3 value by itself if you play it. Block with it and you get a **Head Jab-minus,** pitch it and you get a **Head Jab-minus-minus.**

### Head Jabs as Block

This is the most simple concept to grasp. When you block an attack with a 3 block, you generated 3 value from your card. Sink Below is Head Jab-plus, as it generates 4 value by itself, plus the value of a "sink." I hesitate to assign a numerical value to sinking something, but whatever that is, it has to be at least 0.

Blocking with a 2 block is, then, **bad.** Flesh and Blood cards that block for 2 are simply saying "you will only get a Head Jab's worth of value from me if you play me." Take our namesake card: Head Jab.

### Head Jabs as Pitch

Raging Onslaught is Head Jab. Remember the AP Problem. What it says is that 1 vlaue from Raging Onslaught's damage comes from the AP, not the card itself. Thus, Raging Onslaught might as well read:

    Pay 3 to attack for 6. As an additional cost to play
    Raging Onslaught, lose 1 AP and get +1 damage.

Now, let's simply take a leap of faith and say: Raging Onslaught, **by itself,** is worth 3; thus, 1 of its 7 points of damage comes from your AP, 3 comes from the card itself and 3 comes from the pitch.

Wow, powerful stuff. This, then, means that 1 resource points converts to 1 point of damage. We can look at countless examples. Take a Harmonized Kodachi. It transforms 1 resource into 1 damage.

Take Dash's Teklo Plasma Pistol. It transforms 1 resource and 1 AP into 2 damage. Since the AP is equivalent to 1 damage, a resource is also equivalent to 1 damage.

Now think of the first homo sapiens. You know, the meme with the caveman becoming a modern human. Now look at this:

Wounding Blow, Critical Strike, Brutal Assault, Raging Onslaught.

Those are the same cards. **With 1 more resource, all you get is 1 more damage.** Do the same exercise with Head Jab, Leg Tap, Surging Strike.

Let's go back to Head Jabs as pitch for a while. The maxim is: **pitching a blue is a Head Jab. You will get 3 value out of the 3 resources, as long as the things you are sinking that resource into convert 1 resource into 1 damage.**

And the nice thing is: most cards (except the Head Jab-plusses and -minusses) indeed convert 1 resource into 1 more damage.

### Finding the Head Jabs
Do this exercise with every single card in your deck:

First, find all dimensions in which your card can be a Head Jab. A blue block 3 can be a Head Jab when pitched or used to block.

Second, find out if your reds are actual Head Jabs or not. To do this, simply deduct 1 damage if it uses up your AP and deduct 1 damage from every resource that card costs.

Some cards are harder than others to evaluate. However, reasonably treat an on-hit separately from the inherent value of the card. **An on-hit can't be valued if it never hits, so it doesn't come in to your calculations for value.**

You can, however, say a Snatch is a Head Jab when attacking with an on-hit to draw a whole other card, which, technically, is a Head Jab.

Sometimes it might draw a blue you will have to arsenal, in which case you will have to play and it will be worth only 1 value by itself (to see this, if the red is worth 3 by itself when played, then the blue has to be 2 lower than that).

## What's a good turn?
If your deck is, indeed, using your AP every turn (remember: that's 1 resource you get to enjoy for free as long as you have a card to consume it) and contains only Head Jabs, then, you will generate **13 value every turn cycle.**

This involves hands in which you can go: Head Jab, Head Jab, Raging Onslaught. Or Block for 3 Wounding Blows, play a Wounding Blow.

Many lines will generate 13 value on your turn cycle, because every card is a Head Jab (thus, worth 3*4 = 12) and you get your AP for free every turn.

Some hands are less versatile than others. Take for example a hand with 2 Blues and 2 Raging Onslaughts. You can't do anything with 3 cards offensively, thus, to maximize the value of this hand you **have to block with 2 cards.**

It's as if the hands play themselves out when you subscribe to Head Jab Theory.

Triple Head Jab and a Wounding Blow? welp, if you block with the Wounding Blow you won't have a "soak" for your AP, thus, missing 1 value. Then, the line that get's the most value is no blocks, play all cards.

# What's a good deck?

Now, most decks in CC have the ability to do more than 13 value very turn cycle, and that's because they will play Head Jab-plus in some slots. These cards are *technically* balanced, but, really, in a CC deck, they are mostly just better than actual Head Jabs (see Sink Below, Scar for a Scar, Command and Conquer).

Every deck gets their Head Jabs in different ways:

* Fai gets actual Head Jabs while having a Head Jab-plus in Emberblade and Phoenix Flame (transforms 2 resources into 3 value without using your AP and sometimes gets 1 free value out of Phoenix Flame, or has a 1-resource-into-1-damage play with it). 
* Bravo can often block with two 3 blocks and send in a 4 resource 8 damage card with a Tunic (14 value total, but 1 came from the Tunic). Remember: a 4 resource 8 damage card that uses your AP is on rate. It's just Head Jab with extra steps.
* A Dash IO gets Head Jab-plus in Zero to Sixty, Zipper Hit and Throttle and can turn 1 resource into a Head Jab by getting an item off the top (aka a Head Jab-plus-plus).
* Iyslander has Head Jab-plus in Waning Moon (2 resources into 3 value) and turns your blues like Aether Hail (which are 2 below rate) into on-rate plays when combined with Waning Moon and the taxing effect of a Frostbite (which is, at least, 1 value).

So, to answer what's a good deck, I can only point out that: **if you are constantly getting less than 3 value per card every turn cycle, then you'd better off just playing Raging Onslaughts, Wounding Blows and Head Jabs...** meaning you better be getting more than 13 or more value every turn cycle.

This can be an issue to novice deckbuilders:

* Neglect block 3s and now you miss the versatility of being able to block with some Head Jabs while swinging others.
* Put too many cards that use your AP and you're left having to only block with the excess.
* Don't have enough blues and you have to end your turns with weaker plays.
* Put in too many 2 costs and you end up with a resource floating every turn, effectively bleeding 1 value.
