## Common Terms

### Value

Value is one of those common terms to be "misused." By that I mean that there is no cohesive commonly used single definition of value, which means when somebody says value you don't know if they mean what you think they do and then it just becomes hard to talk about that very fundamental aspect of FAB.

Because of this, I'll try to give a singular definition of value, along with examples of what it is and isn't, as to help build a proper easy-to-understand so that people can refer to the same thing when they say value.

**Definition 1:** Value is a number associated with the byproduct of an interaction within the game as it relates to an amount of damage threatened or prevented.

So, in order to produce value, you **must** do an interaction that either threatens damage or prevents damage. The most common way to do so is by using cards in order to block or attack.

**Value Example 1:** When you block with a card for 3, you produced 3 "points of value," or, more compactly, you produced 3 value. Another way of seeing this interaction is that the card was used for 3 value.

Most people say that a card is worth 3 value. But how can that be the case when there are cards that attack for 10? How is that even close to 3?

**Value Example 2:** When you attack with a Raging Onslaught Red for 7 by pitching a Blue card, you make 3 resources out of your Blue, which was then used by another card (the Raging Onslaught) and your action point in order to produce 7 value.

One way to look at it is that Raging Onslaught attacks for 7 BECAUSE of the fact that it is worth 3 by itself. Then, each resource on every card's cost should be calculated by itself as being 1 value per resource. This means that Raging Onslaught produces 3 value by itself, and your blue produced 3 value (this is a shortcut, as it generated resources which then got converted at a 1-to-1 ratio to the power of Raging Onslaught).

Well, but that only get's us to 6. Now you got to remember that you are using another more "invisible" resource when you play out a Raging Onslaught: your Action Point, which is worth 1.

Finally coming back to example **2,** Raging Onslaught, the card, generates 3 value by blocking OR attacking all the same. The difference between attacking and blocking with it comes down to the fact that the interaction of: "Pitching a Blue card, consuming my Action Point and putting Raging Onslaught on the chain" produced 7 value. The **sources** of that value can be thought of as:
* 3 points of that value comes from your Blue;
* 1 comes from your Action Point;
* 3 comes from the Raging Onslaught itself. In this way, Raging Onslaught card itself was, indeed, worth 3 value.

I like doing this breakdown specifically because I found it simple enough and with an explanatory power that needs very little (if any) other "addendums" or exceptions in order to break down most situations.

This "Action Point" distinction is what, in my experience, gets a lot of people confused, and is a source of why people think that playing out a Raging Onslaught Red is worth more than blocking with it, when, in reality, as long as you have another card that "soaks in" your Action Point, it is the same rate (think Wounding Blow Red).

Just to continue to hammer the point in: imagine your hand is Raging Onslaught Red, a Blue card that blocks 3 and a Wounding Blow Red. You can get to a "10 value hand" if you need to block with 1 or 2 cards, but if you block with all 3 you only get 9 value, and that is, precisely, because you did not have something to spend your Action Point on.

Talking about hammers, think of Anothos. It's not a "1 card for 4". It's a Blue for 3 value and your Action Point for 1 value that makes it so Anothos HAS to attack for 4 to be on rate.

**Value Example 3:** When you draw a Head Jab Red from the on-hit effect of a Snatch Red and arsenal it, the Snatch itself generated 6 points of value (1 comes from the Action Point, remember!).

Since the Head Jab you got was a direct result of Snatch hitting, it makes sense to "append" its value to the Snatch itself. If this same Snatch were to draw a Head Jab Blue instead, then you could say it generated 1 value off of its on hit effect.

The same can be said if it drew a Raging Onslaught Red, though. I like using Head Jab as an example because it is a simple example of "playing this card is worth 3 value." Think Nimblism, playing out an Overpower Red with Reprise active, and so on.

### On rate

**Definition 2:** A card is **on rate** if it indeed was used as 3 value by itself (remembering to deduce cost from the power of the attack and to deduce 1 from spending your Action Point, if it did so). A sequence of plays is "on rate" if each card used in that sequence was **on rate.**

As some additional quick examples to help illustrate these concepts:

* Critical Strike Red is worth 3. Although it attacks for 5, one of its value comes from the resource and the other from the Action Point it consumes, not the card itself.
* Surging Strike Red is worth 3. It costs one more than Critical Strike Red, but it also doesn't consume your Action Point, which is worth 1.
* A Howl from Beyond Red played from banish converts 2 resources into 3 value, something that is not too common. Any conversion above a 1-to-1 in terms of resources or Action Points is above rate.
* Giving *go again* to something is worth 1 value. This is derived from the fact that an Action Point is used by cards to provide 1 value.
* Blocking with a Sink Below Red is worth 4 value without using your Action Point. *Duh.* That's why Sink Below is so great.
* Activating Grasp of the Arknight for 2 resources is a 2-to-1 conversion from resources to value, as a Runechant is worth 1 value.
* Attacking with an active Rosetta Thorn is 2 above rate. This is because it uses one resource and one Action Point in order to produce 4 value.
* You pitched a Blue Card to attack with a Brutal Assault Red and passed. This play was *below* rate, because even though you got 3 Value out of your Brutal Assault and 1 from your Action Point, you used your Blue card as 2 value only. In other words, you did not use every resource generated by your card with a 1-to-1 conversion rate. Another way to view it is: if the Brutal Assault was a Raging Onslaught instead, then that would be on rate, thus, anything that uses an action point and 2 cards should generate, at least, 7 value, again, because a card is worth 3.

As a last example, imagine a turn in which you go: Lead the Charge Red, pitch a Blue for Brutal Assault Red, Rosetta Thorn. This turn was a "3-card-10".

In some sense, **you had an on rate turn,** as you turned 3 cards and your action point into 10 value. However, we can see clear inefficiencies in Lead the Charge, which used a whole card as 1 value (generating an action point), meaning it was a -2 value interaction (you expect a card to be worth 3 and it was worth 1), while the Rosetta Thorn was 2 value above what is to be expected. This is why, in the aggregate, you were "on rate," even though Lead the Charge is a below rate card and Rosetta is above rate.

Still in this scenario, if you, instead, used those 3 cards as all on rate cards and still managed to turn on your Rosetta Thorns, then that turn would've been 2 above rate. So -- and don't take this too literally, but -- **everytime you are below rate, it is the fault of your deck's construction.**

I say don't take it too literally because, in the end, it's all a tradeoff between consistency and power level. This tradeoff is one of the most fundamental parts of a card game, and Flesh and Blood is no exception. But if you see you are *consistently* casting below rate cards to only once in a blue moon get an above rate value out of them, then you *probably* should not be putting that card in your deck.


### Tempo

This one is tricky especially if people come from other more traditional TCGs. I see *so* many people using this term without describing it that it has become a personal pet peeve of mine. It's like a catch-all umbrella term for "something that's important even though I don't know exactly what it is."

Tempo is one of those things that people normally *define by example.* This is because there might not be a single definition of Tempo that encompasses everything a person likes to call Tempo. As you can see, I am a bit obsessed with compact defitions, which is why I will propose a definition for Tempo that might seem weird to most people, as they don't use that word to mean what I'll propose it should. However, I will then attempt to give my justification as to why I like my definitions.

**Definition 3:** Tempo is the amount of cards you have at the start of your turn minus the amount of cards you got attacked with on the opponent's turn.

This definition is extremely simple. It doesn't care if the opponent had an awesome turn or an extremely inefficient turn. It's just that: a number between 0 and 5. But how is that useful?

Tempo defined as such seems to give so little insight as to who is winning or losing, but I *like* that. Tempo *shouldn't* be a measure of who is winning the game per se, although it often *can* explain why someone is. Tempo *shouldn't* be something you blindly want to have. Think of those Lexi vs. Oldhim games in the olden days where the Lexi was desperately shoving arrows into the Oldhim who just blocked with everything, swung a hammer and won in the end. Lexi definitely had the Tempo, but Oldhim was winning all along. So whatever idea of Tempo we have, we need to remember: **Tempo isn't a metric of who's ahead.**

First of all, I suppose we all agree that going second makes you start the game with Tempo. This definition would explain it, as you will start your turn with 4 cards and will have been threatened by none since you can freely block and draw up on the first turn of the game, thus having 4 Tempo.

With this definition, both players have agency as to which Tempo they play each hand at. You can simply get all the Tempo in the world by saying "no blocks" until you're taking lethal damage; that doesn't mean it was the right decision to do so.

A turn cycle can be Tempo Neutral, meaning both players are attacking and being attacked by 2 cards each. It can also be a game in which a single player plays at a high Tempo for 10 turns straight, while the other is just blocking, swinging their weapon and passing.

You *can* decide to play at a high Tempo until you actually **can't.** Under this definition, **grabbing Tempo is trivial; holding it not so much.**

All of that being said, I assume you still need a bit more convincing in order to see how this definition can be useful to help you win your games.

#### Hands Have Optimal Tempo

When you draw up, you need to figure out how to play your hand. What do I block with if I get attacked for "vanilla" damage? What if it has on hits? What if they pop an equipment, does that change the order I block with? What if they cash in their arsenal this turn with a nasty on hit at the end of the chain and I'm caught pants down? What if they just play a setup permanent and pass?

Deciding when and how to block is a huge part of Flesh and Blood. As a matter of fact, it might be the most important part of the game, since, after you decide how to block, sequencing your turn should be a consequence of said blocking decisions.

So, how do I know the Tempo of my hand?

First of all, you can "discard" plays that are inefficient from the getgo. If your hand is 3 Blues that block for 3 and a Raging Onslaught Red, then the play the gets the most value is to block with your Blues and send in the Raging Onslaught.

Most hands aren't so easy to evaluate and will require you to weigh in the value of your on hit effect **and the opponent's on hit effects.** You need to value the chance you get stopped by a defense reaction when you Dominate with Bravo. Correctly evaluating the power of on hits is the other magical part of FAB.

While some effects are easy to calculate, how it might interact with your opponent requires experience to factor in. This is where knowing the Tempo your opponent likes to play in comes in handy.

Say you're playing against a Bravo and they have no Tunic counter or Seismic Surge on board. Now, **their** optimal hand probably involves using 2 or 3 cards to send a Red Crush at you, be it a Chokeslam, Debilitate or Spinal Crush and Crippling Crush. This means that **their** optimal play will most likely involve blocking with 1 to 2 cards.

If you can then line up your hands so that you make it more costly for them to hold on to that play, you can make it so they have to use their cards in a way that they don't want to, which means generating less value than they otherwise wanted to, barring disruption thrown at them.

For example, throwing out two on hit effects might be enough to make them give up one of the pitch cards for their turn, which then makes them have 2 cards in hand and now their best turn is a swing with Anothos for 6. You effectively gained value from exploiting the Tempo in which they wanted to play their hand in. They wanted to play with 3 cards, and you forced them to play with 2, generating less value than they otherwise wanted to, and thus giving you more options as to what to do on your next turn.

Some decks are more versatile than others in terms of the optimal Tempo they might have. Bravo, for example, can frequently threaten the optimal value of their hand after blocking with 0, 1, 2 or even 3 cards. To see this, consider a Bravo with a Debilitate Red in arsenal and a hand composed of 3 Blues and a Crippling Crush and a Tunic resource ready. If they don't block, simply Dominate the Crippling Crush and hope for the best. This line has upside if the Crush hits, but otherwise the resources will be badly spent (4 cards for 11 when it should be 13, assuming the Crush doesn't happen). If they block with 1 card they can send out the Crippling Crush and save the Debilitate for another turn. If they're forced out of 2 cards, send out the Debilitate and arsenal the Crippling Crush; and if they're forced out of 3 cards, simply send the Debilitate and have no arsenal. Note that this works even if one of the Blues is a 2 block, but not if there are two or more 2-blocks in hand, as that would mean you get less value when needing to block with one of them.

This kind of Tempo versatility is, in my opinion, what defines how aggro, midrange or control a deck is. The more their average hand can get to optimal value with different Tempos, the more midrange-y it is. Aggro players get to that optimal value when the Tempo is high, and control players the contrary.

This also explains how when an aggro and control deck meet up the game can be a nice back and forth. The aggro player wants to play a high Tempo, but that also means the control player will play at a lower Tempo, which they also enjoy!


#### Deciding the Tempo

Bear with me, as I will now introduce a one more term that will, hopefully, tie the room together and give us a better understanding of how to evaluate when to switch up the Tempo of the match in those non-obvious sequences. This mostly has to do with how to value a sequence of plays, which is a topic related to [Value][#value], but it does share a root in trying to evaluate games and when to switch up the Tempo. 

**Definition 5:** A **Bet** is a sequence of plays that will either reward you with more, the same or less [Value][#value] than an alternative sequence of plays you had available at the point of decision. The value of a Bet is how much you tend to gain or lose in comparison to the an alternative.

What a mouthful. Hold on for a second as we will unpack this definition by walking through some examples, but first, how does betting relate to Tempo?

Quite simply, actually: everytime you Bet, you will either:

**(a)** come out the other side with less value, thus letting your opponent decide the Tempo of the match for longer as they won't be taking lethal as soon as if you went with a higher value play; or,
**(b)** rake in more value than you could with an alternative "safer" play, possibly spiraling the game into a place where the opponent has less and less of a say in which Tempo they want to play at, effectively giving you control on how they need to play their hand out.

#### Tempo Example 1
Say you're playing Bravo and have a Command and Conquer, a Red Pummel and two Blues that block 3 with no Tunic and no arsenal. Your opponent is attacking you with a Raging Onslaught Red. Now, what is the best line of play?

There is a line of play in which you block with the CnC, a Blue and on your turn attack with an Anothos for 4 and arsenal the Pummel. That will be a line which makes 3 value out of every card used and saves the Pummel for later use.

Now, you could, instead, simply choose to take the 7 damage and present the opponent with a Command and Conquer Pummel, pitching your two Blues in the process. With this line, there are a few scenarios:

**(a)** You get a hit in. The opponent loses the arsenal and discards a card. If we value each card as 3, then this sequence of plays netted you **16 points of value.**

**(b)** You don't get a hit in but save the Pummel (say the opponent blocked for 10). You end up with the Pummel in arsenal and a Blue dead in hand. In this sequence of plays you netted **13 points of value.** To calculate this, note you effectively attacked for 10 and saved a Pummel in arsenal, which, since it is a card, should be valued at 3.

**(c)** You don't get a hit in and played the Pummel (say the opponent blocked for 6, you pummeled and they played a Reinforce the Line). You end up with no arsenal and threatened 10 damage, thus, this sequence of plays netted you **10 points of value.**

The decision to **not** do the play that you knew would net you 13 points of value (blocking for 6, Anothos for 4, arsenal the Pummel) and, instead, **atempt a bet** that might net you: 3, 0 or -3 more value was then a Tempo Play.

If you managed to "hit" your Tempo Play, then you would say you got 3 value from a Tempo Play. Or, in other words, you are 3 Tempo-value positive. You may else end this trade at a net Tempo-value of 0 (for scenario **(b)**) or even negative 3 Tempo-value for scenario **(c)**


#### Tempo Example 2
Your hand is 3 Blues that block 3 and a Crippling Crush and you have a Seismic Surge on the field.

The best value this hand can generate in a deterministic fashion involves blocking with a Blue and Playing out the Crippling Crush by pitching the other 2 Blues.

When you choose to not block and, instead, pitch the third blue to make a Seismic Surge and activate Bravo's Dominate ability, you are doing a Tempo Play, as you might've used your whole Blue for a Seismic Surge creation if the opponent has a Sink Below in arsenal and one in hand, meaning your Dominate clause didn't affect their optimal line given a Crippling Crush.

In other words, they would've blocked the Crippling Crush like that either way, whether it had dominate or not, thus, you "robbed" yourself of blocking with 3 with that Blue you used for a Surge and the Dominate.

So, how much Tempo did you lose in that specific exchange? Well, assuming your Blue could've blocked for 3 on the opponent's turn, then you traded 3 value for a Seismic Surge worth of value, which can be 1 or 0 value by itself. Thus, you lost at least 2 points of value on that Tempo Play.

However, if the Crush effect on Crippling Crush *did* connect, then the opportunity cost was, still, blocking for 3, but you got 2 cards worth of value from the on hit *plus* the value of the Seismic Surge (which again can be 1 or 0 value by itself, unknown to you at the time of creation). Since the discard is random you might even get more than 6 value out of the deal, assuming the opponent is left with a card they can't play that turn cycle, for example. Thus, finally, you netted *at least* 3 value out of your Tempo Play.

#### Tempo Example 3
Your opponent is attacking you but you don't think they will get you into lethal range this turn, but instead get you down to 2.

With your 4 card hand you believe you can force them into lethal range by attacking for 12, potentially getting them to block with a 2 block card that would be better spent offensively on their turn.

You could, also, simply play "normally" (getting 3 value out of each of your cards on block instead of 2 value on play, for example) and have 14 points of value on the turn cycle (say, block for 6 with two cards and attack for 8).

If you go with the attacking for 12 line, you *might* get them to to lose value as they are **forced** to use their hand in a non-optimal way. In that case, the amount of Tempo you get would be equal to the difference between how much value they **could've** gotten if they did their best play minus how much value they **ended up getting** after being forced to do choose another line of play as to not die.

#### Tempo Example 4
The above example really doesn't need the clause that you are being attacked or are attacking for lethal to be a Tempo Play, and can, instead, be generalized to include any scenario in which you make your opponent do a **potentially non-optimal** line with their cards. The most common way to make this happen is with on hit effects. It just so happens that when you are being attacked for lethal, all cards have an *"on hit, ya die"* clause written on them.

Some on hit effects are a "mini form of betting." When you present your opponent with a decision point (to let it hit or not) in which they don't know the exact outcome (in terms of value) of their decision, then you are asking them to, potentially, have a line of play that might yield less value than another, thus being - by defition - a Tempo Play.

To elucidate this, when you attack with a Snatch and the opponent *doesn't* know if the card you'll draw will be worth more or less than the value he'd get by using a card to block the on hit versus to simply use that same card on their turn, then you can make your opponent (through no fault of their own as they don't have all the necessary information to judge the best decision at the time they declare blocks) make a non-optimal play, thus, gaining some Tempo value.

Think of Snatch like this: it plays like a Wounding Blow (3 value by itself) and has an on hit of 0, 1, 2 or 3 value, depending on what you draw off of it. Drew a blue and have to arsenal it? Well, then the on hit was worth 1 value (to calculate this, note that a red being worth 3 on play means a blue is worth 2 less on play). If it drew a red card that will be played in the future, then it was worth 3. Sometimes you already would've had an arsenal either way, in which case it might've been worth 0.

You should, however, separate the value of the Snatch from the value of the *on hit* of a Snatch. If the optimal line from the opponent already involves blocking out the Snatch (say with a Sink below, or a card and an equipment), then you aren't really getting any value from the text on Snatch.

#### Tempo Example 5
Say your hand is a Blue card, a Command and Conquer and a Raging Onslaught. The opponent has an arsenal and you go into your turn with those 3 cards in hand.

What's the best line of play here? In other words, is 1 point of damage worth more or less than CnC's on hit effect right now?

This depends, again, on the opponent's hand and *their* optimal play line. If their best play line already involves blocking with 2 cards and going into their turn with 2 cards, then you **missed on a point of value** by attacking with the CnC instead of the Raging Onslaught. If their optimal line of play *doesn't* involve blocking with two cards, then you, effectively, gained Tempo value from that exchange. **Let's put some numbers to this to make it clearer.**

The opponent's hand is: 3 Head Jab Red and a Wounding Blow. Their arsenal is a Head Jab Red. *(don't call the judge yet just because they have 4 copies of Head Jab)*

Their optimal line involves blocking with 0 cards, playing all 4 Head Jabs and finishing with a Wounding Blow. Blocking with any card means their turn cycle will have less value than not blocking at all (as an *exercise* to the reader, convince yourself that this is true no matter how you block or not block).

If you attack with a Raging Onslaught, assuming no threat of lethal damage, they should simply take it and unleash their fury into you.

If you attack with the Command and Conquer, against their current hand it reads "gain 3 points of value." Block it or not, the opponent will have 3 less points of value than they otherwise would in that turn cycle. Thus, in that scenario, attacking with the CnC is 2 value better than attacking with the Raging Onslaught.

That all being said, you do not possess a non-probabilistic answer to the question "What's the best line of play?" at the time you have to make the decision, in which case you are making a Tempo Play by attacking with the CnC, as it can yield more or less value depending on unknown variables (aka, the opponent's hand).

#### Tempo Example 6
Say you are playing against a Bravo that has an Anothos. You are using every card in your hand every turn for 3 value, plus your action point, but the Bravo is defending it all with 13 value of block (with a Sink Below for example), so you're leaking no damage for multiple turns.

The Bravo *could've* used one of their 3 blocks for pitch in order to unlock the value of their Action Point every turn by attacking with the Anothos, making 14 value out of their hand, but he doesn't, choosing to full block and give up on 1 point of value every turn.

The moment you draw up a hand and literally can't use a card for 3 value on block and have to, instead, use it as 2 value on pitch or play, you are "giving back" value to your opponent. Now one of the turns in which they didn't spend their AP (Action Point) was negated as you also did 1 less value than your optimal line which involved blocking.

If you do that repeatedly, you will be back to parity. Yes, you built up a value advantage since they had to go -1 value than their optimal line could every single turn, but you are *slowly* giving up on that Tempo exchange.

**This happens over multiple turns.** Now let's say you draw up a hand that can, literally, at most generate 7 value (say a hand with triple Raging Onslaught and a Blue) since the opponent is not attacking you. Now, you have to arsenal one of the Raging Onslaughts and effectively use the third one as a zero value card. This just gave your opponent 3 value back.

This explains why full block gameplans can work. They are giving up 1 AP value every single turn when they don't use it themselves, but you will give it back to them slowly over multiple turns as soon as you brick or have to go below on rate value. It's as if the opponent is saying "I won't get maximum value, but neither will you."

This becomes a "problem" for you because decks are finite. Now, most of the time, that's not an issue because when you attack with a Raging Onslaught you are asking for 2 cards from your opponent while only losing one yourself, and, in the long run, the opponent might've given up so much AP value that you can just take it slow, give some Tempo back for them to smack you and unlock your 3 value per card by blocking some, or, if they're simply too far behind, take it on the face and threaten lethal by using a card for 2 value anyways on your turn, but threatening lethal so that they have to use a 3 block card for 2 value too, doing so repeatedly until they die.

Fatigue is a complex thing in Flesh and Blood, and much more can be written about it, but hopefully this example gives a framework as to how full fatigue by deck works, and how a fatigue by damage deck also works.

#### Tempo Example 7
Some cards are, inherently, cards that require you to bet on an outcome. In fact, most plays in FaB are like that: you don't know the precise outcome (in terms of value generated) at the time of play. That **doesn't** mean that most plays are Tempo plays.

Remember: to be a Tempo play, **there has to be a play that generates more value than possible outcomes of an alternative** (even in a probabilistic measure) for it to be considered a Tempo Play. If you're simply taking damage to do a play that generates more value than blocking (after valuing the on hits and their value) on a 5 card hand, that's not a Tempo Play per se, it might be just the best line you can possibly take.

For example:
* If you are deciding between attacking with a Wounding Blow or a Snatch, attacking with the Snatch is **not** a Tempo decision, because the alternative play is not better than this play.
* If you are deciding between two arrows that both have an on hit with the same amount of value (even probabilistic), say Drill Shot versus Searing Shot, then that decision is not a Tempo Play.
* If you are using a card for 2 value instead of getting 3 value by blocking with it (like pitching or playing out a yellow often does) but you *didn't* get a chance to use it for 3 value on block, then that's not a Tempo Play. You're simply doing the best you can with your cards.


Hopefully all these examples made sense to you and by now you are at least convinced it might make sense to define Tempo like so. I **really** encourage everyone to put this definition to challenge so we can better adapt it to be a meaningful term that can be used in FAB. I believe this definition has a lot of meaning behind it and still encompasses the spirit of what it means to lose or gain Tempo, while it also opens up space for other terms to be used as support to this definition such as **betting and pivoting.**
