# ROS Draft - Oscilio

## And The Oscar Goes To...

Oscilio is hard to pull off in terms of ratios, as he is a deck without weapon that can't even guarantee a fatigue strategy because he can't amp without wasting cards (as Verdance can).

That being said, Oscar has very explosive builds like Aurora does and doesn't even ask you to have 30 playables because of his ability to transform a shit instant into a random (hopefully not as shitty) card.

With Oscar you get the ability to churn through hands like Aurora while having reach like Verdance. You get to play 22 cards, and, as long as those cards are good enough, you will absolutely murder the earth decks before they get to cash in their lifegain.

## A Brief Note on Kanoscar

Going for "Kano" (meaning you mostly play Wizard cards) is a waste of deck with Oscar, but I can understand doing it if you also have some amount of instants.

I haven't drafted Kano ever (outside CRU) and don't intend on doing it soon, so there's that. Don't trainwreck and won't have to too (hopefully).


## Ratioscar


I believe you should aim to have **3-6 Red Wizard spells in your deck.** Not much less, not much more. You gotta remember: **YOAO. You Only Amp Once,** so as long as you have one of them as chain enders when you need to, you should already be doing 6+ damage with them, which is enough to close out games. As a matter of fact, the own [LSS Dev Download on Oscar](https://fabtcg.com/en/articles/dev-download-oscilio/) says "aim for 3-6 Sigils, 1-2 tall arcane and 10-15 Lightning cards", so don't call this Moonshine yet.

Your main base should be on Lightning cards. Oscar is all about Volzar. **Play 14+ Lightning cards.** You need a good mix of Sigils, natural Go Again, but don't be too afraid to play non-Go Again and rely on **EoL** to power them out on a single turn. Some cards *really* need that EoL to function properly, but when it does, your turn gets unlocked and you can go nuts.

The rest of the cards can be whatever, really. Blues, of course, and either Wizard block 3s, 3-cost tall attacks (FFS), or general instants/yellows with Go Again. This is one of the main benefits of Oscar, as if you have a dud hand, you can dig twice per turn cycle for better cards. Don't be afraid to do so. This is a race, not a marathon.

Your equipment really needs Flash of Brilliance and Ink-Lined Cloak. Cloak is insane and Flash of Brilliance gives you a lot of consistency. Thankfully, neither Aurora nor Verdance use those very well, so you can expect them to show up a bit later on packs. Just don't pass up on them too late in the draft and you should be gucci.

Flash of Brilliance lets you transform any of your shitty yellow lightning cards into the GOAT Lightning Sigils. This is really big, as rolling a Sigil of Lightning for multiple turns is the easiest way to win a game (be it by bouncing them with Blast to Oblivion, or the head, or Etchings of Arcana). This is kinda the bread and butter of Oscar.

## The Actual Draft List card by card

**Lightning Sigils -** There is Sigil of Lightning at common, Sigil of Conductivity at rare and the majestic spec. **PICK THEM. HIGHLY.** Think of it this way: Playing 1 of those Sigils gets you: 1 amp, 1 resource discount and the "on leave" effect, which can be the Embodiment of Lightning (**EoL**) and others (arcane ward 1 and a whole card). This is, at least, 3 value out of a BLUE card on play. You jam your deck full of those, play as many as 7 of those in your deck, *I don't care. And neither should you.*

**Red Lightning Instants -** There is Electromagnetic Somersault **(S++)** and Electrostatic Discharge **(S tier)**. Everyone knows red Somersault is the GOAT, but in Oscar it's *The* GOAT, because you will also have played 1 more Lightning card, meaning you amp 1 more. They're Head Jab-adjacent, meaning they're not Head Jabs themselves, but pair really well with Head Jabs, gaining that extra amp. Draft a lot of those, and don't be scared of drafting the Yellow versions too later down the pack. They're still on rate if you use the amp they provide.

**Go Again Lightning Attacks -** Fry **(S+)**, Lightning Surge **(S+)** and Flittering Charge **(S+)**, You REVEL in them. Sadly, so does Aurora. The good thing is that you can play the yellow ones more liberally, once again because of the amp they will provide, making them on rate again.

**Wizard Spells -** Etchings of Arcana **(S++)**, Glyph Overlay **(First red copy is S++)**, Trailblazing Aether **(A+)**, Aether Quickening **(A)**. Etchings is great even at Yellow. The Go Again Surges are mid, but necessary if you end up on a smaller amount of Lightning starters, as you can go *Sigil > Volzar > Trailblazing > Chain ender.* I don't value the discard to amp cards AT ALL. You already get amp when playing shitty Lightning cards.

**Other Sigils -** I won't go there unless I *really* have to. Main exception is Sigil of Temporal Manipulation, which can be pitch stacked or whatever.


Second Strike is great, but will need setup. It still is very worth it. A single **EoL** can make your Second Strikes really devastating, as you can start your turn with a Wounding Blow that won't get fully blocked, and then unleash a team of Second Strikes into Sigils, Volzar and all that stuff.

Trip the Light Fantastic and Heaven's Claws are also acceptable cards, but, again, need **EoL** setup. Out of them, of course I value Lightning Form the highest. Going *Heaven's Claws > Fry > Volzar > Arcane* is great. The more **EoL** trickery you have, the better they become. It's sad if they're your chain ender, as ideally you want to be Volzaring an arcane boi, but it's fine.

Blast to Oblivion is so good, but needs setup to be worth it (read: **EoL**). You want to setup a turn where you have an EoL, play a Lightning Sigil, play Blast, play another instant (bonus points if its a red Somersault), pick up Lightning Sigil and get an EoL, replay it and then end with any attack into Volzar Arcane, or just Volzar into arcane. This sounds hard to setup, but can be pulled off using the Headpiece to "transform" your shitty lightning into a Sigil, at which point you will already get the EoL and all you need is a second instant and an arcane damage spell.

Blast to Oblivion can also pick up opponent's stuff, so don't be shy of returning 1 runechant, an EoL or (the best) a Harvest Season from opp.

I will pick generic 3 for 7s at the start of the draft (good practice) and play them no problem in Oscar, but won't do so too late into the draft as I will be trying to fix my other ratios instead. They're great with EoL anyway, as even going Raging Onslaught into arcane is a 3-card-10 (enabled by the already existing EoL).

Shoutout to drafting Yellow Somersault if you have a high amount of 1-cost Lightning chain enders (even as blues). Worst case you Oscar the yellow Somersault away, best case you go Lightning Form with EoL (it hits), Somersault it back, Lightning Form again, Volzar into 0-cost arcane. That's a 4 card 16 enabled by EoL. Defensively you can always go block with 2 1-cost and Somersault them back for a sick 1 card 4 or 1 card 5 (or even 1 card 6!!!). **People won't be drafting Yellow Somersault, so this might come up frequently in draft, be ready for it!**


Flash... What can I say about Flash... I haven't drafted a deck that can use Flashes too well. I think the card is clunky and can't be Oscarded away. There *might* exist a Flash-Open the Flood Gates (OTFG) deck somewhere. Be my guest to find it. I get so many OTFG passed to me that it might be worth it to investigate. It just seems fragile to rely on that, since the opponent will only need a single macro usage to deny your amp 1 (coming from Flash). I won't have a single Flash in my deck unless I have a ton of 1-cost Lightning attacks, at which point I might pick them up to go 4 card 10 with *Flash > 1-cost Lightning > Volzar > Arcane for 5*. Wowee.










## Bread and Butter Turns and Cards

Bread and butter mostly involves Sigils of Lightning, as you will notice.

1. Sigil > Volzar > Etchings, 2 card 4 (5 if you count the EoL it will generate later) that will get you a Sigil back for next turn to keep on churning.
2. Play a Sigil > play some Lightning cards > end with Volzar into Etchings, arsenal the Sigil again to do that next turn.
3. 1-cost Lightning (with EoL on board) > Volzar > 1-cost Arcane (3 card 10, with EoL enabling it)
4. Flash > Volzar > Open The Flood Gates > Wounding Blow, arsenal (never tried it, bad if they have macro out, otherwise sounds ok)
5. Flittering Charge > Sigil > Volzar > 0-cost Arcane
6. Flittering Charge > Sigil > Pop Chest > Play Both Commet Storm and Shock > Let Shock Resolve for 1 > Volzar > Commet Storm for 8.
7. Flittering Charge > Sigil > Volzar > 1-cost Surge with go Again > 1-cost attack/arcane
8. **(On Opp's turn)** Sigil > Activate boots (do this sooner in the match so you're not forced to play an instant you'd rather play on your own turn later down the line), this can enable hands that need the EoL.
9.  Blast to Oblivion > Sigil > bounce opp aura
10. **(With EoL on board)** Sigil > Blast to Oblivion > Somersault, pick up Sigil > Blast to Oblivion > Sigil, optionally bounce something from opp > Volzar > 0-cost Arcane for 8. This was a 4-card 16, enabled by EoL.


## Idea of a decklist

## Specific interactions

This paragraph is so important I'll just paste it again from the Ratios section:

    Flash of Brilliance lets you transform any of your shitty yellow lightning cards into the GOAT Lightning Sigils. This is really big, as rolling a Sigil of Lightning for multiple turns is the easiest way to win a game (be it by bouncing them with Blast to Oblivion, or the head, or Etchings of Arcana). This is kinda the bread and butter of Oscar.

Have a Sigil about to pop off at start of turn? Remember you can activate the Wiz chest to get that 1 resource before it goes away. This enabled me to go *FFS (go again from EoL), Second Strike, Somersault Second Strike, Volzar, Arcane for 6* in a match. It was really "telegraphed" in the sense that blocking the FFS makes me Clown myself, but it worked so who cares.

I consistently pulled off *Sigil > Sigil > Volzar > Pop Chest > Glyph Overlay for 7* in my matches. With the Headpiece getting you one of the onboard sigils back, this is not that hard to pull off. Add in some Frys or Lightning Surges on top of it and you've got big boy reach. It's only a 3-card-8, but it's unblockable 8, which will make Earth heroes be left all sad Clowning themselves. Oh, and this will also set you up for next turn having the leftover EoL.

Shocks are so good. The fact you can go Shock, hold it, activate Volzar, already makes it come in for 2 at instant speed, sometimes even 3 if you have a Sigil to play at instant speed (which you can pickup with Head). This will win you games out of nowhere. It can also be used as an instant enabler for your Flittering Charges, just go **Flittering Charge > Shock > Volzar > 0-cost Arcane for 5** is a 4-card-10 that could've been played as a block 5, throw 5 arcane too, if needed.
