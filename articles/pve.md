# The Concept

**Heroes of Rathe** is a campaign-based legacy boardgame that uses FAB's core mechanics as a backbone system for conflict resolution, both for social and combat encounters.

It's supposed to be like The Darkest Dungeon, with the core gameplay loop being:

* Start by doing a **"Town Turn"** where heroes decide how to spend their off-season: make heirs, invest, hunt, travel; everything that is not a combat.
* Play through events and scenarios that will require you to take stances on the local and global political landscape.
* Go through social combat encounters to gather support, make friends and foes during the Town Turn.
* Embark upon an adventure with non-combat encounters like riddles, traps and social talk with a mix of combat encounters with multiple objectives.
* "Scars" from one combat add onto others until the player heals during their Town Turn later.
  
The character sheets are binders full of combat and non-combat attacks, reputation cards, currency, weapons, equipments, heroic deeds and contact tickets.

# General Thoughts and Problems

The main thing about this game is having user-created cards to represent things they have accomplished. For example, as the outcome of a social combat, they can "generate" a card that says that they have a deed issued by the queen, gained through social combat, that can now be used when talking to servants of the regent to either instantly win other small qualms or use it as an argument in the future when they see fit.

I currently don't "know" this game in the sense that I don't know whether or not it is a *boardgame* or should have a DM to mediate it. I want to, hopefully, not need a DM and instead have automated flow campaigns, but if that makes the game too "streamlined" or boring, then maybe we should lean more into the RPG aspect of it. In that case, I think it might be a hard game to DM because it would involve creating many custom cards ahead of time, not to speak about the difficulty to marry the combat (both social and non-social) with the feeling of an RPG.

I have thought about having cards you "burn" for successes and failures. For example, you gain numbers 1 through 5 in "charm" at the start of play and need to use all 5 of them in order to gain back a 1 through 6. This way you will progress only if you fail, and you have to choose when to fail and when to win. The problem with this is that it is hard to prevent failing when it shouldn't matter, effectively trivializing the whole system. One answer to this would be the DM mediating and players only being able to play their cards when requested by the DM.

It's also an issue that I don't really know who to make this game for. I've already said this, more or less, but balancing for boardgames versus for RPGs is very different. I don't want to make an RPG that is too self-absorbed in mechanics, but I also don't want to make a boardgame that has too fiddly irrelevant systems just to mimick a fantasy RPG game about everything.

In my mind, I'd want to make some cards and do a "premade" campaign as a test, with highly scripted gameplay. I don't know how to fit this into the RPG side of things, however. Should the players be "talking" a lot and choosing what to do from their own imagination? Should I simply present a bunch of choices and then the whole roleplay side of things kind of gets thrown out of the window.

I suppose as I'm writing this I can see some possible avenues to remedy this, which is also *"systemizing roleplay"* in a way. That is, making the whole decision-making process of what to do to be something that would, by necessity, be optimal iff. it goes according to what the character itself would do.

To achieve that, cards need to be **SPECIFIC.** Events need be relevant to the players in some way. This means no generic "goblins attack you" combat, or "irrelevant" social encounters. This means that when players choose paths to take, they are meaningful and epic. Don't offer decisions that are not really choices.

This is hard on the game designer because you need to make something very well tailored to not be just a generic sequence and give the idea of agency as well as supporting different outcomes. A DM would solve this naturally, so, we have another fork to take into account when deciding to go *GM-less* or not.


## Social Encounters
### Social Combat Cards
Cards used in social combat are: **Statements** (Auras), **Rebuttals** (Attack Reactions), **Objections** (Defense Reactions), **Interjections** (Instants) and **Arguments** (Actions).

Statements modify both parties' layout, and instead of having power, they have color-coded types such as: Fallacy, Logical, Lies, etc. These colors are to provide **Support** for Arguments. For example, a Disinformation Statement might have a static effect of making Fallacy Statements cost 1 more to play, or simply provide 2 color support while supporting Fallacy Arguments.

Statements are like Resources in MtG, while Arguments draw from their power to deal damage. They're sort of like Resources and Equipment in a way.

Other arguments might have the equivalent of "Combo" in Katsu, or might simply Intimidate and do nothing else (looking at your argumentative skills, brutes). Arguments may also get support from other game objects such as heroic deeds, contacts or even currency.

The flow of a social combat encounter envolves, generally, laying out Statements and then doing a sequence of Arguments in which Rebuttals and Objections are traded until someone "scores", finally dealing "damage".

The scoring system goes through a system of "Rock-Paper-Scissors", where Logical Arguments win against Fallacies, who wins against Lies who wins against Empirical Arguments who wins against Mockery who wins against Logical Arguments. These points add up round by round and stop only at the end of the social combat, where they get subtracted by their "counters" on a 3-for-2 basis (that is, 2 Fallacies subtract 3 Lies).


### Argument
**Arguments** are social encounters with a list of predetermined binding outcomes to both the winner and loser. This list is done by each party determining the contents of the argument and deciding levels of compromise for each party, in which both parties agree to what should happen should one lose or win the argument, as well as tie.

Unlike audiences, players here are attacking the other party. The parties alternate turns like so: 1-2-1-2-1-2. At the end of these 6 turns of play, the difference between "damage" dealt will decide which binding outcomes come to fruition.

### Audience
**Audiences** are social encounters in which an argument is won by gathering support. Cards represent who is attending the Audience, being court members, named characters and general public, for example.

These audience cards have "support slots" and act like a tug of war in which, during the players turn they can fulfill "checkboxes" on the audience and gather an amount of support. These checkboxes are for example "Make a 3 Logical Arguments", or "Object twice". At the end of a turn cycle, count the total support gathered and tally them. It's a straight "race" where different vote thresholds will grant different amount of rewards and punishments to both parties.
