# The Bard Class

All of this started with my vision for a bard class in FAB, in which I explored what a Bard should have. I took inspiration from existing cards and the already existing *ethos* of a bard in FAB, and the takeaways I had of **what makes a bard in FAB were:**

* Bards have "each hero" effects.
* Bards give things to others (tokens mainly, looking at Tales of Adventure).
* Bards care about things happening outside their board (Final Act cares about cards in all pitch zones)
* Bards use cards for no value in multiplayer, purely for politics (this I had to ignore to design a competitive class)
* Current bards have Songs that are all chain enders with zero value except for politics (and Melody's ability)

Similar to Stealth, playing a Song means *nothing* by itself currently, as the subtype's value comes from other effects (namely, *Melody*).

Whatever it is I did, I wanted to make sure of a single thing: **Final Act needs to be playable.** Why, you ask me? Because I think it is a really cool card.

## The Basic Ethos

I landed on some mechanics and ideas which I will further go into detail in this document. The main ones being:

* **Embellish,** a keyword that lets you *REMOVE* go again from the card to get an additional effect which is, most of the time, a choice for a benefit to both players.
* **"Non-hit effects".** Swing Big but in multiples. **Bards don't have beneficial on hits.**
* **Negate** is big in bard. An opponent can, sometimes, outright decline the song you want to play, in which case you get a redraw to try to "recompose" your act.
* **Bards care about pitch.** This is "free" flavour we gain by already having the word "pitch" that is already explored in Final Act.
* **Homage to heroes.** Bards make "homages" to other heroes and cards by singing tales about them, letting them "grab" effects from all other classes in a fun way.

As an example of a card I'm really proud of designing:

    **Splinter the Crown of Thorns (Red)**
    1 Cost - 3 Power - Block 3
    Bard Action - Song Attack
    --
    You may **Embellish** *(When you play this, you may choose to Embellish. If you do, it loses Go Again)*
    Each hero may pay {R} and put a card from their arsenal on the bottom of their deck. Each hero that does may prevent the next 1 damage that would be dealt to them this turn.

    If this is Embellished, it gains +1{P} and "If you have played a 'non-attack' action card this turn, deal 2 arcane damage to the opponent."

    **Go Again**

**This card can transform your AP into 3 damage, which is above rate, but the card is 1 below rate when not embellished.**

If the opponent pitches for the effect they're going above rate by transforming 1 card into 1 prevention + 1 card (1 above rate) and then also have the floating resource for paying the AB.

## Storytellers

Bards are storytellers by design, and I wanted to incorporate that feeling with the idea of head jabs as "parts of a song". The fantasy was weaving parts of a story and coming in with a ***BANG!!*** at the end to everyone's surprise.

For example, I remember imagining:

    Bard plays "There Once was a Fair Maiden"
    *and then continues*
    "The Evil Count Shows Up"
    the audience *(the opponent)* has a chance to think where this story is going *(should I block now? Should I pitch? Should I just let him continue?)*
    "Increasing Crescendo" *(this is the bard upping the stakes of the story, preparing everyone for a grand finale)*

    The opponent thinks "Should I be worried of where this story is going? Well, maybe, but let's see how it ends..."

    And the bard surprises everyone by playing "Deathly Serenade", where the main character ends up getting seduced and blablabla lore...

    The audience might've expected it *(say by correctly pitching before, or blocking at the correct time)* in which case the story was **below rate.** Otherwise, the bard did it and everyone was caught by surprise and now pays the price.

This is sorta the fantasy I had in mind for a bard. Some chain starters (story setups), some "acts" that can twist and turn the story, building up to a finale or misleading the opponent into thinking something will happen when it's another thing entirely, and a conclusion (chain ender).

**Now, hang on, isn't that just Katsu?**

*Well... yeah.*

## Embellish

One of the ways to accomplish the fantasy I had of "chaining songs" was to add a way to give Go Again to them. I landed on a keyword named **Embellish** that reads:

    You may **Embellish**. (When you play this, you may choose to Embellish it. If you do, it loses go again.)

This gives flexibility on whether you want an additional effect at the cost of your AP or not. So you can end a song "abruptely" and maybe catch opponents unexpectedly, something Katsu can't do well.

**Now, this creates a problem... If the AP can always be used as 1 value, then I'm making Head Jab-Wounding Blows out of every card, making bard extremely consistent.**

## Playing with Pitch

Bards and pitching makes a lot of sense. The word is so evocative of music and I wanted to make the opponent's pitch also matter to you, sort of like making a "duet".

This means that bards should have effects based on cards in their pitch zone. This is a design that plays on that:

    **Solace in Aether (Red)**
    0 cost - 3 block
    Bard Action - Song
    ---
    You may **Embellish.**

    Each hero may pitch a card. If they do, they gain 3{Life}.
    If this is Embellished, deal 3 arcane damage to any target.

    **Go Again**

**This idea of "may pitch" is non-existant since you can only pitch to pay costs.** This would create the need to introduce rules to make simply "pitching when instructed to" a thing. You still get the resources generated by the pitch.

After the card resolves the pitching part, the opponent will still have resources up to pay for AB and you will still have resources to pay for more things, so it's "equal" in that sense. Of course you know what you're going to do and whether the opponent's leftover pitch will still be relevant while they don't, but they are still getting, at least, 3 value out of their card by gaining 3 life.

You can make your version of a 3-card-10 with Solace in Aether, no Embellish, pitch a blue to play Raging Onslaught.

If the opponent pitched, they will get 3 value out of that card (basically "blocking" your Head Jab) but might be left with leftover resources. If they *didn't* pitch, then you get to also ping them for 1 arcane damage with your weapon and your hero ability:

    Bard Hero
    ---
    After you play a Song on your turn, gain {R}.

    After you play a Song on your turn, each opponent may pay {R}{R}. If they do, they draw a card.
    

And the weapon:

    **Mockingbird**
    Bard Weapon (2H)
    ---
    Whenever you play a Song, you may activate ~ an additional time this turn.

    **Once per turn Instant - ** Deal 1 arcane damage to any target. Activate this only if you've played a Song this turn.

    **Once per turn Instant - {R}{R}{R}:** Gain 1 Action Point.

The weapon is a way to make free value until you remember the opponent will *probably* have resources left over from pitching. But if they don't (as they might), then you've always got a way to go above rate.

The hero ability I believe also encapsulates the bard ethos: you get +1 value and I get +1 value.

## "Non-hit" effects

I wanted to build on the idea of Swing Big, which I think is an awesome card design that speaks precisely to what bards do: **they give agency to their opponents.**

Instead of going Katsu where choosing to block the wrong on hit can lead to catastrophic disasters, I wanted to make you feel "okay" even if you messed up.

This allows me to build block 3 Head Jabs that have a negative on hit, or a positive "non hit". The non-hits benefit both players, differently from Swing Big, like:

Leg Tap with "You May Embellish, if you do, this gains +1{P} and 'Non-hit, each player makes an Eloquence token'", or Quicken token, you get the idea.

These tokens can benefit the opponent but can **really** benefit you since you built a synergystic deck with having those tokens in mind, but you're letting the opponent have agency over your value. They might simply reffuse to play this game with you and take everything. Even so, that's good for you.

## Bard Value Proposition

The main source of value per turn for the bard comes from letting opponent's pitch be left unused. Much like forcing a two card block on a 4 power card with "on hit 3 value" like Snatch is value in the sense that you made the opponent use one whole card as 1 value, the bard can let the opponent's pitch float away for value.

If the opponent refuses to interact with you (aka. refuses to block, or in the bard's case: pitch), then you can get a ton of value that way.

You, however, become vulnerable if you don't pitch yourself. This bard class sorta *forces* you to be pitching, but that's okay in my book as, well, *you need to have good pitch, man!*

The gameplay I think about goes something like this:

## Gameplay Idea

You start your turn on full tempo, playing a few songs. When you play your first song the opponent almost always will pitch for it to "cash in" the value.

**Let's do some turns play-by-play:**

### Turn #1

You play a Solace in Aether (Red) from arsenal. Opponent pitches a blue for it and so do you, so you got 3 value out of the card and the opponent "blocked" 3 value from it too. It's as if you've played a Head Jab and they blocked it, but they still have 3 resources left-over to use for AB or other means.

Your hero ability triggers and the opponent pays {R}{R} to draw a card and you gain {R}.

You then play Raging Onslaught, paying with the floating resources and having {R} leftover.

Opponent blocks 6, takes 1.

You activate your weapon pitching another blue card (your 4th card) to gain 1 AP and then you play another Majestic song with your 5th card:

    Ode to the Rotting Tome (Yellow)
    0 cost - 2 block
    Bard Action - Song
    ---
    You may **Embellish.**

    Each hero may put an attack action card from their graveyard into their arsenal. If they do, they discard a card.

    If this is Embellished, create a Frailty, Inertia or Bloodrot Pox token under each opponent's control.

    **Go Again**

You get back a CnC from your graveyard and **don't** Embellish the song. Opponent doesn't grab anything as their arsenal has a card in it. You don't discard because you have no cards left in hand.

Your hero ability triggers and the opponent has only {R} leftover, so they don't pitch a whole other card for it. You also gain {R}.

You pay {R}{R} to play the CnC and they block 6.

You end the turn with 2 more activations on your weapon and ping them twice. They block 1 with their leftover resource and take 1 arcane.

At the end of all of this turn, this is what happened:

* You both gained 3 life.
* You attacked for 7 + 6 physical plus 2 arcane using 5 cards (1 below rate).
* The opponent is left with 2 cards in hand after blocking 6. (on rate)

This turn was 1 below rate overall although you did force a block on CnC. **Interestingly,** if the opponent chose to pitch a blue card to your second hero ability trigger, the opponent would be +1 on that trade. They would go +1 value from exchanging 2 resources for a whole card and could've freely blocked the 2 arcane pings.

### Turn #2

You have 3 cards in hand, being two:

    **Shred my Heart Out(Red)**
    0 cost - 3 power - 2 block
    Bard Action - Song Attack
    ---
    You may **Embellish.**

    If this is Embellished, it gains +1{P}.

    **Go Again**

and a CnC.

You start by playing out a Shred my Heart Out and don't Embellish it.

Your hero ability triggers and the opponent pitches a blue to draw a card and your gain {R}.

The opponent doesn't block and takes 3.

You play another Shred my Heart Out (Red), the opponent doesn't pitch and you gain another {R}.

You now have {R}{R} floating and opponent has 1 cards in pitch with {R} floating.

You attack with the CnC and ping the opponent twice with Mockingbird. They prevent 1 and take 1.

This turn you had 3 + 3 + 6 + 1 (13) value out of 3 cards. (since the opponent blocked 1 of the arcane)

The opponent still has 4 cards in hand.

So, overall, you were 3 above rate "on rate".

A better turn would've


You play

    **Killer Solo**
    2 cost - 6 power - 3 block
    Bard Action - Song Attack
    ---
    You may **Embellish.**

    Each hero may pitch a card. Each hero that does draws a card.

    If this is Embellished
